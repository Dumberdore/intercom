2. Proudest Achievement
What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

Ans.

This code submission is probably one of the coolest things I have done recently. Hear me out :)
I recently started learning Golang and wanted to do a project in it. I am also very new to CI/CD tools (probably a year of experience).

Since I read your email (today, around 8 am)
    - I was thinking about the problem between the morning run and breakfast
    - Had a pseudo-code ready by the time I opened my laptop
    - Implemented the code in and around 5 hours

I was really happy that I could write a small program from grounds up using a new tech I barely know!

While creating GitHub repo for my submission, I was thinking about how to make it stand out.
So I implemented the CI pipeline using GitHub actions! Again, I haven't used gh-actions before.
I spend another hour creating a pipeline, which will
    - Test my code
    - Build binaries for macOS, Linux & Windows
    - Creates a release uploading those binaries

I think I made maximum out of this Take-Home-Test and thank you so much for the opportunity.

There are other professional achievements at my current job and previous jobs but this one is probably my favorite!
